# SlideshowApp
This is a React Slideshow App that allows users to view a series of slides with titles and text. The app lets users navigate through the slides using the "Next" and "Prev" buttons, and restart the slideshow using the "Restart" button. The app is easy to use and provides a seamless experience for viewing multiple slides in a single session.
